# While loops & for loops

Practice time! We will use `for` loops to make three exercises.

Make a new exercise directory and add three empty JavaScript files:

- `even-odd-reporter.js`
- `multiplication-tables.js`
- `grade-assigner.js`

Good luck!

## 1. Even Odd Reporter

Write a loop that iterates from 0 to 20. During each iteration, check whether the current number is even or odd. Use `console.log` to view the output.

Since this is your first looping exercise, use the following code to get started:

```
for (let i = 0; i <= 20; i++) {
    console.log(`Is ${i} even or odd?`);
    // TODO: determine if i is odd or even
    // TODO: use console.log
}

// Expected output:
// 1 is oneven
// 2 is even
// 3 is oneven
// 4 is even
// ...
```

Adjust the code as you see fit. To calculate whether a number is odd or even, check out the [Remainder operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder).

## 2. Multiplication tables

We all know know them from elementary school: multiplication tables. Write a script that prints the multiplication table of 9. The output looks like this:

```
// 1 x 9 = 9
// 2 x 9 = 18
// 3 x 9 = 27
// etc...
```

**Bonus**: use a nested for loop to write the multiplication tables of 1 until 10. Start the loop at the lowest number (in this case 1). The output now looks like this:

```
// 1 x 1 = 1
// 1 x 2 = 2
// 1 x 3 = 3
// etc...

// ...
// 9 x 1 = 9
// 9 x 2 = 18
// 9 x 3 = 27
// ...etc
```

When you successfully complete the bonus, your script prints 100 lines to your console (10 for each multiplication table).

## 3. The grade assigner

For this exercise, your start off with an existing function that determines the grade based on a score of 0-100:

```
function assignGrade(score) {
    if (score > 90) {
        return "A";
    } else if (score > 80) {
        return "B";
    } else if (score > 70) {
        return "C";
    } else if (score > 65) {
        return "D";
    } else {
        return "E";
    }
}
```

Write a for loop that iterates from 60 to 100. This value indicates the "score" of a student. During each iteration, call the `assignGrade` function with the current and log the following statement:

```
For scoring 80 points, you get an C
```

When you successfully complete the grade assigner, your script prints 40 lines to your console (one for each score).
